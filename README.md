# Timer Pong

A physics-based bouncing ball simulation with interactive paddles and a timer.

## Project Description

The **Timer Pong** is an interactive game where balls bounce around within a defined screen boundary, interacting with paddles and walls. Users control two paddles to keep the balls in play within the time limit.

Features:
- **Physics-based Ball Motion:** Balls move and collide with walls, paddles, using realistic physics.
- **Two Paddles:** One controlled with arrow keys, the other with `A` and `D` keys.
- **Game Timer:** A countdown timer when it reach 0 the game will end in a draw.
- **Dynamic Background:** The simulation uses a custom background.
- **Game Over and Restart Mechanism:** A clear message appears when time runs out or a ball exits the boundary, with the option to restart.
